# MNIST CLASSIFIER

This repository contain the basic image classification ``hello worlds!``, i.e., MNIST digit classification using the following neural network architecture:
* Multi-Layers Perceptron (MLP)
* Convolutional Neural Network only (No dense layer at the top)
* CNN + Dense 

It also come with tensorboard to visualize the training loss and accuracy with validation.
